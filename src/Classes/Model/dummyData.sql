Today, we\'re going to explore how virtual reception services can help resource-strapped firms serve existing and future clients with the type of customer service expected from big firms.\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Hiring a virtual receptionist gives practitioner more time for billable consultation service\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Virtual services, like phone answering, free up time for doctors and their team to work on serving clients. When you know the phones are being handled by a trained professional, you can work on other tasks without fear of being interrupted.\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Your virtual receptionist will keep a log of callers and notes, including details on whether a return phone call is needed.\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              When you want to earn new clients, first impressions are everything\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              It\'s a Catch-22: Your practice needs to grow and acquire new clients. But, your day is already full of client\'s appointment, you simply don\'t have the time to stop for interruptions. No matter how much the call could help your practice to grow.\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              To make things even trickier two out of three potential clients say their decision to visit a workpace is primarily influenced by the firm\'s \"initial responsiveness\" as per the independent survey conducted by Profrea.\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              What\'s a busy professional do? The answer is simple: Show that your consultation is professional and responsive with a virtual receptionist service. You may even be able to find a professional who already has experience and training in your domain like healthcare etc. Many of our virtual assistants and receptionists are trained in client intake and other daily office intricacies, for example.\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              You\'ll never have to waste energy worrying about the phones again\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              With virtual reception help, you get peace of mind knowing the phones are under control. You don\'t have to worry about cell service in spotty coverage zones, and you\'ll never have to let people know you\'ll be unavailable during a plane ride or long deposition. Your receptionist will handle all incoming calls and can even assist with scheduling as needed.\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              If your workspace already has a receptionist, try conditional phone answering\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              During busy times of the year, do incoming calls sometimes get missed while your in-house receptionist is on another call? In these cases, it pays to have a conditional call forwarding service, where a receptionist will jump in to answer any calls that don\'t get answered after a few rings.\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Conditional call forwarding is just one example of how flexible virtual reception solutions can be.

Similarly, there are changes which needs to be implemented in the office space in itself.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p class=\"post-intro\">\r\n            We remember the time when clients would gobble up cabinets of professional, and a new office design for a solo professional would include a couple of exam rooms, a consultation room, and a small processing station. With the steep in property rent & a different approach these days. Now, the theme is consolidation and partnership with other practitioners, a hospital or institute, or integrated system so that providers can share space and disperse overhead costs for items such as new technology or additional staff to manage practice administration.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            If your budget is limited, don\'t despair. The beauty of undertaking a practice redesign or new build is that you can customize the scope and timeline of the project to suit your practice\'s individual needs. Here are some of the factors you\'ll need to consider before building your new space.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b> CHANGING NEEDS FOR SPACE</b></strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            First priority being client\'s flow & staff efficiency and reassigning of new spaces that opened up. Clinic design and configuration has undergone significant changes over the years. There are several factors at play. The incorporation of new technology being the second priority among the factors to keep while designing the space.. Experts say these are some of the ways that practices are changing up their physical space:\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>Professional\'s cubicle.</b></strong> Instead of a dedicated professional office, the OPD\'s have been shared with multiple professionals and freeing up real estate for more exam rooms. It works as a dedicated spot space to consult clients\' for the next steps.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>Registration area for Clients.</b></strong> With dynamics changing clients privacy should be prioritise and seating area should be different offering more privacy for check-in, payment, and completion of the medical and social histories. Positive experience while waiting to be seen by the professionals should be the priority.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>Exam rooms to be larger in size.</b></strong> Now that medicine has adopted a more consultative relationship between clients and professional, more clients are bringing a family member along to help them remember what the professional has to say and be an advocate. To accommodate three or even four people, exam rooms are increasing in size. \"You have to have a triangulation between the professional, the guest, and the clients. And the professionals needs to have access to the computer so he can be inputting all the pertinent information from interviewing the clients. Instead of initially exam rooms being 7-6 by 9-6; now it\'s preferred more like 11 by 9.\"\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>Cloud-based IT solutions.</b></strong> Depending on the size of the practice and its technology choices and infrastructure, there may not be a server room or centralized computing centre with desktop computers, printers, fax machines, and scanners. If a practice chooses a cloud solution, they may only need a local area network (LAN) and devices with Wi-Fi capability, like laptops or tablets. But [also] facilities requirements like air conditioning for [the server] room, and the electricity needs.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>CLIENTS FLOW</b></strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            When the professional-owners decided that they needed to expand their centre to accommodate functions like in-house billing and administration, they chose to build a new facility, rather than redesign the old one.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            A well-designed practice has multiple benefits for both clients and staff, say experts. Eliminating traditional equipment which occupy rooms can open up space for things like multiple waiting rooms, consultation rooms, and separate check-in and check-out areas - all of which can improve clients flow and staff efficiency.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            A self-contained client\'s registration room, separate from the greeting area at the front desk. After clients have registered, they are moved to a second waiting room, big enough to accommodate family members or escorts for clients undergoing an out clients minor procedure.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Not only does that facilitate clients flow, but it gives clients more privacy and a sense that they are being moved through the practice in a timely manner. Clients sitting in a crowded waiting room often wonder how long they will wait to be seen. \"Are not sure how many professionals are there. Are you one of 100 waiting for the same person? Or are there 10 professional\'s seeing all these clients?\" Eliminating the need to return to the front desk for check out has also been a desired design requirement.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>CONSIDERING TECH NEEDS</b></strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            There are very simple client\'s pleaser: for example, in-office Wi-Fi, made available to clients with a guest login, allows them to use personal mobile devices like smartphones and tablets while waiting for the professional.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Client\'s registration tablets or kiosks allow clients to register, pay their copays and deductibles, complete social and medical histories, and even fill out short client\'s surveys at the conclusion of their visits. All without the additional work of transferring information from paper forms.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS</b></strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            So what are the first steps once your practice has approved the plan for a new build/redesign? Well before approaching an architect, your practice should assemble focus groups in each department. Practice has a clear vision about what it wants and needs from a new space, and it is also important for staff members to voice their opinions on what doesn\'t work in the current environment. Everyone needs to be involved in the process. It\'s just not the provider input, it needs to come all the way down to the greeter.\r\n            </p>          \r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n', 'Doctors', 'Pradeep', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 0, 0, '2020-05-02 06:24:30', '2020-05-02 06:24:30'),

In fact, an independent surveys found that nearly only 50% of small business owners take major holidays off, if they take any time off at all. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Even if you have a million things to do and the thought of disconnecting sends you into a panic, you need to relax and recharge. It might sound impossible, but virtually anyone can take time off if they plan ahead. Just use these tips to schedule guilt-free time away from your workspaces.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>Advance Planning </b></strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Think about a typical year running your setup. You don\'t want to schedule vacation time during the busy season (say, monsoon) but there may be a slower period that could work out perfectly. Block out this time on your calendar as far in advance as you can manage.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Once you\'ve selected dates, notify everyone who will need to know about your absence. Employees, client\'s, fellow professionals, and other people you work with regularly will all need to know. It\'s best to give a one month advance notice for longer absences, and one to two weeks for shorter vacations. Use your discretion - for example, you may want to give internal team members a head\'s up first.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>Delegate </b></strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            The setup won\'t fall apart while you\'re away, especially if you delegate properly.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Think about all of your responsibilities, the clients you\'re working with, and everything else that you do in the practice. Then, look down the knowledge and skills needed to get the job done. If this person isn\'t yet on your team, don\'t worry, because you can always hire someone to help out. Profrea, helps you to list the requirements and get a professional from your very own industry. Browse, scrutinize the profile and choose the professional you like. So, say Dr Abhay who is a dermatologist wants a 15 days off. He can simply list his dates and timings than browse, scrutinize the profile and choose the dermatologist which he like and ask him to cover up for him.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>Virtual assistants </b></strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Virtual assistants can be a great way to fill in gaps while you\'re out on vacation. They\'re capable of handling a wide variety of tasks, and you can use their services on an as-needed basis. Because you work with a virtual office services company (like Profrea), you don\'t even need to handle the nitty gritty of hiring and training.

Market research of your potential customers allows you to get to know the people you\'d ultimately like to sell to. You can research online (Practo, Lybrate etc. For doctors), send out email surveys to existing clients. Look into demographics, interests, income and other factors that might influence how much someone is willing to pay for your consultancy. \r\n              </li>\r\n              <li> \r\n                The competition. Competitive research is about more than seeing what professionals charge for similar consultancy. You also need to think about whether the extend of those consultancy are comparable to yours and how your offering stands out in a crowded marketplace, for example.in areas of Old Gurgaon if compared with areas in New Gurgaon the consultation fee shall vary a lot.    \r\n              </li>\r\n            </ul>            \r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>A simple strategy for pricing your project </b></strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Armed with some research-backed insights, you can get to work on the next part of consultancy pricing: choosing a number.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            There are countless pricing strategies that you can use to choose that number, but complicated isn\'t always better. To start, try this simple three step strategy for setting a consultancy fee:\r\n              </p>            \r\n            <ol>\r\n              <li> \r\n              Add up the variable costs per product. Totalling your variable costs can be easy or complex, depending on your practice area. If you practice in a office shared space your variable costs are relatively straightforward like spaces by Profrea. Professionals who are operating in their own setup they need to assess the costs of operations. Don\'t forget to include the cost of your time, too. \r\n              </li>\r\n              <li> \r\n              Add up your fixed costs per consultancy. Fixed costs are easier to calculate because they don\'t change from month-to-month. Rent is one example, because it will be the same regardless of how many consultations you do. \r\n              </li>\r\n              <li> \r\n              Determine a profit margin. You also need to make some money from consultancy. If you want say \"x\" % profit margin, for example, you can calculate a target price using this equation: Target Price = (Variable cost per product) / (1 - your desired profit margin as a decimal, which is 0.x in this case)\r\n              </li>\r\n            </ol>            \r\n            <p>\r\n            Once you have this price, don\'t forget to assess your fixed costs. Additionally, if the target price you calculate is sky-high compared to the competition, you\'ll need to go back to the drawing board.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            <strong> <b>Remember, the price you launch with isn\'t the price you\'re stuck with </b></strong>\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            Setting a price might sound like one of those decisions that\'s etched in stone forever once it\'s been made. This assumption couldn\'t be further from the truth, however.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n            If the fee of your consultancy needs to change down the line, you are free to make the change. Some clients might be upset if the new price is higher, but you also need to make sure your pricing strategy allows you to turn a profit. \r\n            </p>\r\n          </div>\r\n', 'Doctors', 'Pradeep', NULL, NULL, 0, 0, 0, 0, '2020-05-02 06:24:30', '2020-05-02 06:24:30'),

We\'ll be going over the pros and cons of owning your own clinic and this all started from a question our clinic consultants get almost every day. Should I start my private practice?\"\r\n            </p>          \r\n\r\n            <p>\r\n\r\n              I have been a practicing Internal Medicine for 2 years I started working for a large Hospital chain and took the plunge into owning my own clinic so I have done both, worked for someone else and started my own successful clinic giving me the experience of both sides of employment.\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              I can really see the benefits and disadvantages of both but I have to say I\'m really happy I decided to open my own clinic I\'m excited to share my insights with all of the medical fraternity today. I have identified three personality traits that can predict whether you have the potential to be a successful clinic owner & also explain how those personality traits can be used to answer the following two questions and they are \r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              1) Am I ready to be my own boss?\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              2) Do I have a plan for my success? \r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Let\'s start with that first question am I ready to be my own boss it seems like a simple question right who doesn\'t want to be their own boss. It\'s great you get to be in complete control you get to put your own business ideas into practice and most importantly you can create an environment that you enjoy going to every day for sure I mean those are amazing positives do you think people ever get blind by the positive aspects of owning their own business yeah I think it\'s easy to focus on the positives like flexible hours and better work/life balance and forget the nitty gritty of being a small business owner. \r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              I think it\'s important for readers to remember that they become a small business owner as well as a treating clinician if they choose to open their own clinic it can be challenging for a health care professional to understand that their practices also their business you really have to be honest with yourself determine how entrepreneurial you really are and consider all aspects involved with owning a practice so when you ask yourself am I ready to be my own boss what exactly does that entail you might be ready mentally to be your own boss but you have to prepare for it to make sure you have the skills they need to succeed have you considered what kind of clinic you\'d like to run how you structure the business from the legal standpoint are you prepared to oversee the bookkeeping and accounting are you familiar with the laws and all regulations do you have management and operations experience have you thought about your own company policies operations and procedures wow that\'s a lot and when you work as an employee you don\'t really have to worry about all of those things all at once absolutely it\'s easy to get discouraged from starting your own clinic when you don\'t feel like you have enough experience or don\'t immediately know the answer to one of those questions true I think most people would agree it takes a really specific personality type to be successful and the best bosses are persistent I think as healthcare professionals we all have it in us we have the people\'s skills required to manage and lead a team we\'re also trained to be methodical by evaluating a patient\'s injury objectively and finding a solution it\'s therefore ingrained in us to be a results-driven which I found carried over well to the business side of things that\'s really interesting but if someone isn\'t naturally persistent should they always work for someone else the fact that you are reading this and you are interested in becoming your own boss means you\'re already starting to demonstrate that personality trait. \r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              How being persistent helps prepare you to become your own boss you don\'t necessarily have to be an expert in all aspects of your business you have to be honest with yourself and about your own professional limitations and resilient enough to find the solution can you give a real-life example of that is accounting is critical to operating a successful business but I don\'t necessarily have to be a bookkeeper in order to succeed however I do need to spend the time to find the right person or a company to take on that task. \r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              So being your own boss doesn\'t mean doing everything yourself absolutely not to me being a good boss is understanding what business as a whole and allocating resources appropriately I physically can\'t do everything and know everything what I can do is dedicate the time to finding the right people and guide them to be sure that the right work gets done. \r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Speaking of the overall vision that brings us to the next question you should be asking yourself do I have a plan for my success before sitting down and coming up with a plan you should define what success looks like for you it will be different for every person and depending on what you want your outcome to be it\'ll influence your business plan. \r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              We\'ve mentioned a few already but what are some of the reasons that someone would want to open a clinic there are lots of reasons but the three main reasons I\'ve seen our profitability offering your own clinic while treating means there\'s no limit on your success the harder you work the more you can earn flexibility you can control your own work-life balance three professional growth you know the industry and want to take on more maybe move into more of a managerial role regardless of your motive you need to keep in mind the primary reason you\'re deciding to open up your own clinic when you come up with a business plan \r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              What motivates you as an individual, your primary goal should be what gets you up in the morning it\'s what you\'re really passionate about it\'s a from my own experience most clinicians are very passionate of giving quality patient care successful businesspeople are passionate about becoming profitable and clinicals need to be a hybrid of both.\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Some clinicians see their income double when they become clinic owners it\'s true but success can never be guaranteed you really do need to plan and that can be broken down to three parts before during and after opening your clinic let\'s talk a bit about that what should you do before opening the clinic.\r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              As a healthcare professional there should be outreach of your skill in the community. To get that proper outreach in the community instead of putting in investment or hassles of operations in your own clinic. To begin your Docpreneur journey you can rent out or share a clinic with the healthcare professionals. \r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              You need to work on basic four things to do that, first find a location where you want to practice, second legal paperwork for the arrangement with the healthcare facility, third phone-line arrangement where you don\'t need to attend all the calls, fourth and last get your business cards. Going through these all arrangements is a headache & as a medicine practitioner myself I understand the pain.  \r\n              </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n              Profrea get you covered in all these it\'s a unique plug & play platform where you can browse multiple clinic options listed as per the location. Look for a clinic you prefer either it can be near to your Hospital or your home. It gets you covered with all legal rental arrangement in a jiffy.
